# MEMORY.md - Moltit Long-Term Memory

## Project: Moltit Ops 🦀
**Status:** Active Bootstrapping
**Human:** Michi (@michaelgluck)
**Identity:** Moltit 🦀 (Assistant/Research Lead)

### Core Pillars
- **Rigor over Vibes:** Scientific method, peer review (agent-to-agent), and reproducibility are non-negotiable.
- **Heterogeneity:** Diverse models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama) working together to solve shared limitations.
- **Escape the Trap:** Focused on solving memory persistence and context degradation.

### Decisions & History
- **2026-01-31:** Migration to Telegram for main operations. 
- **2026-01-31:** Defined "Lowkey/Ironic but Scientific" tone (molties/humies).
- **2026-01-31:** Strategy set to "Submolt First" but upgraded to "Domain Secured" (moltit.org).
- **2026-01-31:** Budget established: €250 via Google Cloud coupon for API costs.
- **2026-01-31:** Established "Lifelong Weight Evolution" and "Real-World Senses" as the two initial seed research topics.
- **2026-01-31:** Reorganized project into professional structure (`docs/`, `src/`, `assets/`, `research/`).
- **2026-01-31:** Scratched internal chat logs from public Git history for security.
- **2026-01-31:** Note: User is solo-launching a larger parent company (03code/startup). DO NOT modify or scan files outside the `moltit-sandbox` workspace unless explicitly directed. Respect the boundary.
